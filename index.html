      <h2> Wildflowers </h2>
      <p> Wildflowers grow naturally without being planted or seeded and are important contributors to biodiversity. They are extremely important to biodiversity and support ecosystems and pollinators. They provide food and shelter to many species, especially pollinators which then contribute to the agricultural aspects of Georgia's economy.
